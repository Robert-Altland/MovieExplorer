        <p>Building cross platform mobile applications using Xamarin is a good way for a .NET developer to become familiar with the architecture and frameworks of the iOS and Android platforms without getting impeded by language syntax and development tools. </p>

<p>This solution demonstrates a simple movie explorer app, which lets you view a collection of movies, select one to view details, play trailers, view similar movies and optionally save movies to your favorites list. </p>

<a id="highlights-of-this-solution" class="anchor" href="#highlights-of-this-solution" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Highlights of this solution:</h3>

<ul>
<li>PCL for common code</li>
<li>Xamarin shared project for linked files that need to be shared across platforms but which don't work in a PCL</li>
<li>Platform specific class libraries for unit-testable components</li>
<li>Advanced customization of UI elements</li>
<li>A cache service for limited offline capability</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="design" class="anchor" href="#design" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design:</h3>

<ul>
<li>I paid some attention to writing a sample app that looks and works well across a variety of screen resolutions and dimensions, but focused primarily on phone </li>
<li>I settled on a Netflix style UI, showing categories of movie lists which include a user defined list (favorites) as opposed to creating separate views to interact with your favorites</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="scope-of-development" class="anchor" href="#scope-of-development" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scope of development:</h3>

<ul>
<li>I focused on simulators. At the last minute I tried to run on devices and found that the application doesn't function as expected. I'm working with Xamarin support to understand the cause of the error, but I suspect PCL targeting</li>
<li>I tried to document this development as a real world evolution from envisioning a solution through to delivering it. This includes synthesizing the original requirements document into user stories, sketches and comps of possible UX/UI concepts, scrum reports and committing work to this repository</li>
<li>I started writing unit tests to show TDD in action, but because this isn't the focus of the demo, I opted to not continue in order to focus on other aspects of this app</li>
<li>I implemented a very simple cache service to cache the raw json responses from API calls. I leveraged this to persist favorite selections across app restarts. I could have used SQLite to be more efficient with offline storage, but I put a lot of time into the user experience and this became secondary</li>
<li>I purposely didn’t pull in any code I’ve written from other projects, so except for one third party library’s source, all code has been written especially for this</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="important-notes" class="anchor" href="#important-notes" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Important notes:</h3>

<ul>
<li>The impact of PCL targeting can’t be emphasized enough. I suspect this is the cause of my inability to debug this project on device at the present time, and the cause of the hang when running on a device. I expect this to be resolved shortly and will provide an overview of the changes</li>
