{"name":"Movie Explorer","tagline":"A sample solution demonstrating best practices for building cross platform mobile applications using Xamarin","body":"Building cross platform mobile applications using Xamarin is a good way for a .NET developer to become familiar with the architecture and frameworks of the iOS and Android platforms without getting impeded by language syntax and development tools. \r\n\r\nThis solution demonstrates a simple movie explorer app, which lets you view a collection of movies, select one to view details, play trailers, view similar movies and optionally save movies to your favorites list. \r\n\r\n###Notes about this solution:\r\n* PCL for common code\r\n* Xamarin shared project for linked files that need to be shared across platforms but which don't work in a PCL\r\n* Platform specific class libraries for unit-testable components\r\n* Very light unit testing\r\n* Task based asynchronous service which handles interaction with the TMDb API (https://www.themoviedb.org)\r\n* A cache service for limited offline capability (raw json for simplicity, not something more efficient like SQLite)\r\n* A fairly simple Netflix style user interface (favorites are presented as a category on the home screen)\r\n* iOS and Android apps (phone, not tested on tablet) \r\n* Project artifacts like requirements, sketches, and comps (no prototype was needed because of the simple UI)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
